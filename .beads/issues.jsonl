Install `a2a-ai-provider`\n2. Add A2A agent configuration to Settings UI (new section similar to MCP servers)\n3. User can add agent card URLs\n4. Test with Google Codelabs demo agents (burger/pizza sellers)\n\n### Phase 2: Agent Discovery\n1. Fetch and parse agent cards (`.well-known/agent.json`)\n2. Display agent capabilities in UI\n3. Auto-discover agent metadata (name, description, skills)\n\n### Phase 3: Integration\n1. Make A2A agents available as delegable resources (like MCP tools)\n2. AI can choose to delegate to A2A agents mid-conversation\n3. Show which agent is responding in UI\n\n## UI/UX Considerations\n\n1. **Settings → A2A Agents** (new tab/section)\n   - Add agent card URL\n   - Display agent metadata\n   - Connection status indicator\n\n2. **Chat Interface**\n   - Visual indicator when A2A agent is responding\n   - Agent attribution (\"Response from Code Analysis Agent\")\n\n3. **Storage**\n   - Store agent configurations in Capacitor Secure Storage\n   - Key: `a2a_agent_configs`\n\n## Risks \u0026 Limitations\n\n⚠️ **Alpha Status**: `a2a-ai-provider` is not production-ready\n- Consider experimental/beta feature flag\n- Clear warning in UI about alpha status\n\n**Mitigations:**\n- Implement as optional feature (disabled by default)\n- Wait for package to reach beta/stable before enabling by default\n- Monitor Vercel AI SDK issue #7442 for official support\n\n## Testing Resources\n\n- **Google Codelabs**: Burger/pizza seller demo agents\n- **A2A Inspector**: Web-based testing tool\n- **a2a-samples**: GitHub repo with examples\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] User can add A2A agent URLs in Settings\n- [ ] Agent card is fetched and metadata displayed\n- [ ] AI can delegate to configured A2A agents\n- [ ] Responses from A2A agents are properly attributed in UI\n- [ ] Works with both OpenAI and Anthropic chat providers\n\n## References\n\n- Prior research: cawcaw-dks (Dec 4, 2025)\n- Research document: `history/a2a-research-2025-12-04.md`\n- A2A Protocol: https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/\n- Community provider: https://github.com/DracoBlue/a2a-ai-provider\n- Vercel tracking: https://github.com/vercel/ai/discussions/6639","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-24T19:24:25.137855791-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T19:24:57.958487757-05:00"}

{"id":"cawcaw-rk7","title":"Research agent-to-agent (A2A) communication patterns","description":"# A2A Research Findings\n\n## Key Distinction: MCP vs A2A\n\n**Critical understanding**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) serve different purposes:\n- **MCP**: Agent-to-tool integration (what caw caw already has) - connects AI to external tools/APIs via JSON-RPC 2.0\n- **A2A**: Agent-to-agent communication - enables multiple AI agents to collaborate and communicate with each other\n\n## Multi-Agent Workflow Patterns (Vercel AI SDK)\n\nThe AI SDK supports 4 core multi-agent patterns:\n\n1. **Sequential Workflow**: Agents execute tasks in order, passing results to next agent\n2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks\n3. **Routing**: Director agent routes tasks to specialized agents based on context\n4. **Orchestrator**: Supervisor agent coordinates multiple sub-agents with feedback loops\n\n## Implementation Options for caw caw\n\n### Option 1: AI SDK Built-in Multi-Agent Support\n**Approach**: Use Vercel AI SDK's native multi-agent workflow capabilities\n\n**Pros**:\n- Already using AI SDK - no new dependencies\n- Native TypeScript support\n- Works with both OpenAI and Anthropic providers\n- Lightweight, runs client-side in browser/mobile\n- Patterns: sequential, parallel, routing, orchestrator\n\n**Cons**:\n- Limited documentation (newer feature)\n- Need to implement orchestration logic ourselves\n- No pre-built agent templates\n\n**Best for**: Lightweight multi-agent workflows within single chat session\n\n### Option 2: Microsoft Agent Framework (AutoGen + Semantic Kernel)\n**Approach**: Integrate AutoGen's multi-agent conversation patterns\n\n**Pros**:\n- Mature framework with proven patterns\n- Built-in conversation management\n- Supports various agent roles (assistant, executor, critic)\n- Strong multi-agent coordination\n\n**Cons**:\n- Python-first (would need JS/TS port or API wrapper)\n- Heavy dependency for mobile app\n- May require backend service\n- Overkill for simple use cases\n\n**Best for**: Complex enterprise multi-agent systems\n\n### Option 3: OpenAI Agents SDK\n**Approach**: Use OpenAI's official multi-agent SDK\n\n**Pros**:\n- Official OpenAI support\n- Native multi-agent patterns\n- TypeScript/JavaScript support\n\n**Cons**:\n- OpenAI-only (wouldn't work with Anthropic)\n- New SDK (less mature than alternatives)\n- May require OpenAI-specific features\n\n**Best for**: OpenAI-exclusive workflows\n\n### Option 4: Custom Orchestration Layer\n**Approach**: Build lightweight orchestrator on top of existing AI SDK integration\n\n**Pros**:\n- Full control over behavior\n- Minimal dependencies\n- Optimized for caw caw's specific needs\n- Works with all providers\n\n**Cons**:\n- Need to build and maintain orchestration logic\n- More development effort upfront\n- Risk of reinventing wheels\n\n**Best for**: Highly customized workflows specific to caw caw\n\n## Architectural Considerations\n\n1. **Client-side vs Backend**: caw caw runs client-side with no backend - limits framework options\n2. **Mobile Constraints**: Capacitor mobile app needs lightweight solutions\n3. **Multi-Provider Support**: Must work with both OpenAI and Anthropic\n4. **MCP Integration**: A2A should complement existing MCP tool integration, not replace it\n\n## Recommendation: Hybrid Approach\n\n**Phase 1** (Low effort, immediate value):\n- Implement **AI SDK sequential workflow** pattern for simple multi-step tasks\n- Example: Research agent → Writing agent → Review agent pipeline\n- Use existing AI SDK, minimal new code\n\n**Phase 2** (Future enhancement):\n- Add **routing pattern** for specialized agent delegation\n- Example: User asks question → Director routes to appropriate specialist (code, writing, research)\n\n**Phase 3** (Advanced):\n- Implement **orchestrator pattern** for complex multi-agent collaboration\n- Feedback loops, agent-to-agent communication\n- Consider backend service if needed for complex orchestration\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Prototype sequential workflow with AI SDK (2-3 agents in pipeline)\n2. Test with both OpenAI and Anthropic providers\n3. Design UX for multi-agent conversations (show which agent is speaking)\n4. Evaluate if custom orchestrator needed or AI SDK patterns sufficient","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T14:02:45.58979229-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T14:10:13.950853118-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T14:10:13.950853118-05:00","close_reason":"Research completed with comprehensive findings documented: MCP vs A2A distinction clarified, 4 implementation options analyzed with pros/cons, phased recommendation provided"}
