{"id":"cawcaw-1o8","title":"Fix MCP OAuth refresh token scope mismatch error","description":"When refreshing expired OAuth tokens, the token refresh fails with 400 error: 'cannot request scope `mcp.e-gineering.com/mcp:access` not provided by refresh token'. The refresh token request is including the original scope parameter, but OAuth 2.1 spec says refresh tokens should not include scope unless requesting a narrower scope. Need to investigate if we should: 1) Remove scope from refresh requests entirely, 2) Only include scope if explicitly narrowing permissions, or 3) Store the original scope from the refresh token and use that instead of the authorization scope.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-03T21:28:09.204659213-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-03T21:28:09.204659213-05:00","labels":["bug","mcp","oauth"]}

Currently they may be displaying as inline text which is hard to read. Need to investigate the markdown rendering library (streamdown or react-markdown) to add custom rendering for JSON content. Consider: 1) Detect JSON strings in tool results, 2) Wrap in \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e with JSON syntax highlighting, 3) May need custom markdown renderer component.
