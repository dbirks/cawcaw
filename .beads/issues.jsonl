{"id":"cawcaw-12b","title":"Redesign tool call UI to be flat wall-to-wall with dark green background","description":"Change the tool call UI design from the current button/card style to a flat, wall-to-wall design that stretches from edge to edge. Requirements: 1) Remove rounded corners (use square corners), 2) Use flat dark green background color, 3) Stretch full width (wall-to-wall, not constrained like a button), 4) No shadow or elevation effects, 5) Keep collapsible functionality. This will make tool calls visually distinct from chat messages while maintaining a clean, flat design aesthetic.

The refresh token request is including the original scope parameter, but OAuth 2.1 spec says refresh tokens should not include scope unless requesting a narrower scope. Need to investigate if we should: 1) Remove scope from refresh requests entirely, 2) Only include scope if explicitly narrowing permissions, or 3) Store the original scope from the refresh token and use that instead of the authorization scope.","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-03T21:28:09.204659213-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-03T21:28:09.204659213-05:00","labels":["bug","mcp","oauth"]}

Requirements: 1) Make assistant messages full-width (not constrained like user messages), 2) Add small padding on left and right sides, 3) Hide the assistant avatar icon on the left, 4) Keep the text readable and well-formatted, 5) Maintain distinction from user messages (which should keep their bubble style).
